# Deep Learning with Elixir: Axon, Nx and Livebook
Demo livebook built for [Atlanta Code Camp 2021](https://www.atlantacodecamp.com/2021).

# Usage
Note that Livebook requires Elixir 1.12 in order to use `Mix.install` which the included livebook leverages.  It has been tested on macOS (Intel) and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS; ymmv on Windows or Apple silicon.

Use one of the **Livebook** stand-up methods described in detail in the [Livebook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook) repo, and open the livebook of interest under the `livebooks` folder.

In the case you have installed the Escript version and need extra environment vars/config set to launch your server, there is a `run_livebook.sh` bash script included to wrap up your starting logic.
